1) Download sra files with sratoolkit
2) Fastqdump into fastq files
   Theoretically the solid reads should not use fastqdump, but abi-dump instead. But i checked the results,
the reads are the same, just there are misterious C within the reads. So I removed all the Cs in the fastq
files with C script. 
    Alternatively, it can be down with: abidump and solid2fastq scripts. The final fastq results are the same.
3) Reads mapping with Shrimp2.
   Refer to shrimp2 documentation for more details about the command: https://github.com/compbio-UofT/shrimp/blob/master/README
The command I used:

time gmapper-cs -L referenceData/rnafasta/gencode.v46.transcripts-cs \
-1 fastq/lastGremoved/processed/SRR1204091-p.fastq.gz \
  -2 fastq/lastGremoved/processed/SRR1204092-p.fastq.gz \
-N 16 -p opp-in -Q  \
--strata --single-best-mapping --all-contigs \
--min-avg-qv 20 \
